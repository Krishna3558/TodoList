# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

It is a Vite React project where I create website structure and layout of the to do list and use some new concepts of React JS. 
In this project I use Context API to connect the dark mode and having the records of different list function.  
In this I use local storage to store the data locally to the browser of the user so that user can review the Todo list.
